## 1.6 Compile On Windows

### 1.6.1 Dependency Libraries

#### 1.6.1.1 libpcap

Install [libpcap runtime library](https://www.winpcap.org/install/bin/WinPcap_4_1_3.exe).

Unzip [libpcap's developer's pack](https://www.winpcap.org/install/bin/WpdPack_4_1_2.zip) to your favorite location, and add the path to the folder ```WpdPack_4_1_2/WpdPack``` to the environment variable ```PATH``` . 

####  1.6.1.2 PCL

To compile with VS2019, please use the official installation package [PCL All-in-one installer](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases).

Select the "Add PCL to the system PATH for xxx" option during the installation.

### 1.6.2 Installation

Installation is not supported on Windows.



## 1.7 Quick Start

**rs_driver** offers two demo programs in ```rs_driver/demo```.

- demo_online.cpp

​	`demo_online` connects to online lidar, and output point cloud.

- demo_pcap.cpp

​	`demo_pcap` parses pcap file, and output point cloud. It is based on libpcap.



To build `demo_online` and `demo_pcap`, enable the CMake option `COMPILE_DEMOS`.

```bash
cmake -DCOMPILE_DEMOS=ON ..
```

For more info about `demo_online`, Please refer to [Decode online LiDAR](doc/howto/07_how_to_decode_online_lidar.md)

For more info about `demo_pcap`, Please refer to [Decode pcap file](doc/howto/09_how_to_decode_pcap_file.md)



## 1.8 Visualization of Point Cloud

**rs_driver** offers a visualization tool `rs_driver_viwer` in ```rs_driver/tool``` , which is based on PCL.

To build it, enable the CMake option CMOPILE_TOOLS.

```bash
cmake -DCOMPILE_TOOLS=ON ..
```

For more info about `rs_driver_viewer`, please refer to [Visualization tool guide](doc/howto/13_how_to_use_rs_driver_viewer.md) 



## 1.9 API files

For more info about the `rs_driver` API, Please refer to:
- **Point Cloud message definition**: ```rs_driver/src/rs_driver/msg/point_cloud_msg.hpp```, ```rs_driver/src/rs_driver/msg/pcl_point_cloud_msg.hpp```
- **API definition**: ```rs_driver/src/rs_driver/api/lidar_driver.hpp```
- **Parameters definition**: ```rs_driver/src/rs_driver/driver/driver_param.hpp```,
